# Doctrine Fit — The Manasseh Effect (Mirror → Water → Fire)

## One-line doctrine thesis
**Repentance restores standing; repair restores footprint. Forgiven doesn’t mean undone.**

## The Manasseh Effect (definition)
The far-reaching, generational consequences of sin that persist even after personal repentance and forgiveness—because actions install patterns into people and systems.

## Trespassers (definition)
A trespasser is not merely “a sinner,” but a boundary-crosser who:
- normalizes what should have stayed unthinkable,
- installs corrupt norms into systems,
- and leaves residue that others inherit.

## Mirror (Truth without spin)
- “I changed” ≠ “I fixed what I broke.”
- Forgiveness ≠ automatic healing of institutions.
- Repentance can be real while consequences remain real.

## Water (Repair + deprogramming)
Water is the repair phase that dismantles what was installed:
- removing corrupt infrastructure (habits, channels, policies),
- re-teaching publicly when harm was public,
- rebuilding trust through time and consistent practice.

**Water rule:** You don’t only repent—you deprogram the room.

## Fire (Consequences + refinement)
Fire is the reality that:
- some consequences run their course to purify systems,
- accountability is not cancelled by mercy,
- time-based refinement restores what words cannot.

## Anti-Manasseh Protocol (operating standard)
1) Confess specifically (Mirror)  
2) Remove infrastructure (Water)  
3) Re-teach publicly (Water)  
4) Restore through time (Water → Fire)  
5) Accept consequences without weaponizing “forgiven” (Fire)
