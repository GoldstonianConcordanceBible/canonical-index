# The Manasseh Effect
**Subtitle:** (Working) Forgiven ≠ Undone: Residue, Repair, and Generational Consequences  
**Series/Ecosystem:** The Goldstonian Doctrine (Mirror → Water → Fire)  
**Status:** Drafting / In Progress  
**Primary Theme:** Personal repentance can restore the person, but it does not automatically reverse downstream damage released into families, institutions, and generations.

## What this book argues
**The Manasseh Effect** names a reality visible in 2 Chronicles 33 and 2 Kings 21:  
- A leader can repent and still leave behind installed norms, habits, and cultural corruption.  
- Mercy can be real and consequences can still be real.  
- Forgiveness restores standing; repair restores footprint.
