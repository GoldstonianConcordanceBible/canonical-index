## Rule 1: Canon wins
This repo is the canonical index. Keep titles, series/volume, and ASIN/ISBN consistent everywhere.

## How to add a book
1) Add a YAML file in `/books/{series}/`
2) Update `CANONICAL_INDEX.md`
3) Keep keywords consistent across videos

## Formatting
- Use exact capitalization for titles
- Prefer one Amazon link per book
- Keep “one_liner” under 140 characters
