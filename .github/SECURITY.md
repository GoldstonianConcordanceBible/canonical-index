# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This repository is a metadata index. We support the latest `main` branch and the most recent release tag.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you’ve found a security issue (including supply-chain risks, malicious files, or credential exposure):

1. **Do not open a public issue.**
2. Email the maintainers or use GitHub Security Advisories (preferred):
   - Repo → **Security** → **Advisories** → **New draft advisory**

Include:
- What you found
- Where it is in the repo (path + commit hash if possible)
- Steps to reproduce/verify
- Any suggested fix

## Disclosure
We aim to acknowledge reports quickly and will coordinate a fix and public disclosure timeline when appropriate.
