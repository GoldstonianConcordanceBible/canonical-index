# Series VIII — Augmented Discernment (Mirror • Water • Fire • Order • Witness • Crown)

**Series Thesis:** AI can assist *discernment* as a secondary tool, but it cannot replace the Holy Spirit, Scripture, conscience, repentance, counsel, or obedience.  
This series trains **Augmented Discernment**: *humans under God* using AI under supervision.

## What this series is (and isn’t)
- **Is:** a Bible-grounded formation system for using AI without outsourcing authority.
- **Is not:** “AI as prophecy,” “AI as spiritual authority,” or “AI as replacement for prayer and Scripture.”

## Volumes
1. **VIII-01 — Mirror:** truth-telling, motives, self-deception detection.
2. **VIII-02 — Water:** study discipline, clean method, clean sources, clean summaries.
3. **VIII-03 — Fire:** authority tests, warfare of attention, obedience under pressure.
4. **VIII-04 — Order:** governance for agents, guardrails, risk models, supervision.
5. **VIII-05 — Witness:** testimony, publishing, audit trails, citations, receipts.
6. **VIII-06 — Crown:** allegiance, idolatry tests, eschatology-proofing, vows.
