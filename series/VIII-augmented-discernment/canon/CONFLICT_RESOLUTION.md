# Conflict Resolution — Series VIII

When two statements clash:

## Step 1 — Authority order
Scripture (canon) > prayer/repentance/counsel/fruit > verified sources > AI output.

## Step 2 — Evidence test
- Can this be traced to a real source?
- Does it fit the immediate context of the passage?
- Does it produce good fruit over time?

## Step 3 — Record the decision
Log resolution in:
- `receipts/decisions/` (what changed and why)
- Update `data/series-VIII.crosslinks.json` if it affects cross-links
