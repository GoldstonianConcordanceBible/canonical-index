# Global Guardrails (Series VIII — Augmented Discernment)

## Non-negotiable authority order
1) **God / Holy Spirit (primary)**
2) **Scripture (measuring rod)**
3) **Wisdom practices** (prayer, repentance, counsel, fruit over time)
4) **Tools** (AI, agents, summaries, search)

> Tools may assist **observation** and **organization**.  
> Tools may not command **doctrine, calling, identity, or obedience**.

## Forbidden content patterns
- AI-as-divine-authority: “God told me because AI said…”
- Prophetic certainty from tools
- Fabricated citations/sources
- Accusations framed as facts
- Panic-fueling, rage-bait, revenge language
- Legal/medical/financial guarantees (especially public-facing)

## Required labeling (always)
- **Fact** (traceable)
- **Inference** (explicitly labeled)
- **Opinion** (explicitly labeled)
- **Unknown** (when not verified)

## Verification rules
- Scripture references must be accurate.
- Non-obvious factual claims require sources or must be removed.
- Doctrine requires **2+ witnesses** (cross-links) where applicable.
- Prefer primary sources; avoid “source laundering” for major claims.

## Counsel gates (must escalate)
If it involves:
- children / family custody dynamics
- legal action or accusations
- medical/mental health
- finances or contracts
- public testimony that can harm reputations  
→ require **counsel + accountability + receipts** before action.

## Publish gates
Before any publish:
- QA checklist completed (volume-specific)
- Tone: calm, truth-first, restrained
- Claim ladder applied (Fact/Inference/Opinion)
- Corrections path defined

## Corrections policy
If a statement is found false or overstated:
- Correct it quickly
- Log what changed and why
- Preserve receipts and the revision trail
