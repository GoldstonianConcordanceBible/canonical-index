## Is AI a spiritual authority here?
No. AI is a secondary tool.

## Can AI help Bible study?
Yes—context, cross-links, summaries—if verified and kept under Scripture.

## What’s the main danger?
Outsourcing authority: letting tools produce “certainty” that bypasses prayer, counsel, repentance, and obedience.
