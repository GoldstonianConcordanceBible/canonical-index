# VIII-02 — WATER
**Theme:** Clean study, clean method, clean sources

## Purpose Thesis
Train readers to use AI for study support (context, cross-links, summaries) without losing the text or inventing sources.

## Key tests
- Can every claim be traced?
- Is the summary faithful to context?
- Did we separate “maybe” from “certain”?

## Practices
- Source ladder (primary → secondary → tool)
- Context map (who/what/when/why)
- Cross-link verification (2–3 witnesses)

## Outputs
- Passage Map
- Cross-Link Table
- Verified Summary (with refs)
