series_promise: >
  A three-volume formation system that teaches believers how to use AI without spiritual shortcuts:
  truth-telling before God (Mirror), clean interpretation and context (Water), and practiced obedience
  that produces justice, mercy, and durable discipleship (Fire). Built to pair with the Goldstonian
  Concordance Bible ecosystem and to function as a safety-first “rule of use” for AI.

guardrails:
  - "No divination: AI is a tool, not a voice of God."
  - "No ‘prophecy by prompt’: Scripture + wisdom community govern decisions."
  - "No obsession loops: attention discipline is part of obedience."
  - "Pastoral boundaries: mental-health and spiritual-care disclaimers included."
  - "Receipts-first: prompts, outputs, and decisions documented for accountability."
