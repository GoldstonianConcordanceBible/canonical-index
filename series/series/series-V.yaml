series_promise: >
  A New Testament concordance series read in conversation with Ethiopian tradition—without treating
  tradition as Scripture—so readers can trace how the Gospel becomes a formed people: worship,
  teaching, ethics, suffering, mission, and resilient obedience. Ends in a lived “Walking Rule”
  that integrates the whole witness into daily life.

positioning_notes:
  - "Scripture-first: the New Testament governs; tradition is a companion lens, not a replacement."
  - "Sober canon handling: Ethiopian tradition is integrated carefully and clearly labeled."
  - "Formation focus: every volume produces practices, community rhythms, and teachable outlines."
  - "Anti-sensational: Revelation handled with safety rules; no hype, no fear-merchandising."
