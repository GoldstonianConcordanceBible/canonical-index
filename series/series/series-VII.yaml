series_promise: >
  A six-volume, Scripture-first discernment series that contrasts the spirit of antichrist with the
  way of the true Christ—across the Bible, church history, modern systems, and future pressures—
  without sensationalism, date-setting, or fear-merchandising. The goal is formation: clear eyes,
  clean doctrine, and faithful obedience under pressure.

guardrails:
  - "No date-setting, no speculative prophecy charts as doctrine."
  - "No fear-merchandising: the tone is sober, pastoral, and courage-building."
  - "Scripture governs; historical examples are illustrative, clearly labeled."
  - "Discern by fruit: humility, truth, mercy, justice, holiness, endurance."
  - "Keep focus on Christ: resistance is secondary to worship and obedience."
