# Series I — Tanakh First: The Covenant Operating System (Ethiopian Canon Anchored)

A six-volume “operating system” for reading the Bible with clarity, courage, and consistency—anchored in the Ethiopian Canon (81 books) and built to scale with no ceiling without turning into chaos.

Each volume follows the Concordance Spine:
- Purpose Thesis
- Placement + Canon Notes (Ethiopian vs Protestant/Catholic/Orthodox)
- Narrative / Argument Flow
- Core Theology
- Messiah Thread
- Goldstonian Cross-Links
- Hard Questions (answered gently)
- Preacher’s Toolkit
- Walk in the Word
- Prayer + Practice

Under the hood: Mirror → Water → Fire
- Mirror: see what’s true (God, self, moment)
- Water: cleanse confusion (context, canon mapping, interpretation rules)
- Fire: live it (justice, mercy, repentance, worship, resilient obedience)
