## Series I — Tanakh First: The Covenant Operating System (Ethiopian Canon Anchored)

The **Goldstonian Concordance Bible Series I** is a six-volume “operating system” for reading the Bible with clarity, courage, and consistency—anchored in the **Ethiopian Canon (81 books)** and built to scale with no ceiling without turning into chaos.

Each volume follows the **Concordance Spine**:
- Purpose Thesis (why the book exists)  
- Placement + Canon Notes (Ethiopian vs Protestant/Catholic/Orthodox)  
- Narrative / Argument Flow (what happens / what’s argued)  
- Core Theology (God, covenant, justice, mercy, holiness)  
- Messiah Thread (prophecy → pattern → fulfillment)  
- Goldstonian Cross-Links (echoes across Scripture)  
- Hard Questions (skeptics, interfaith, honest objections—answered gently)  
- Preacher’s Toolkit (sermon skeleton + teaching outline + small-group plan)  
- Walk in the Word (personal rule + community action)  
- Prayer + Practice (weekly discipline + closing prayer)

Under the hood is **Mirror → Water → Fire**:
- Mirror: see what’s true about God, self, and the moment  
- Water: cleanse confusion with context, canon mapping, and interpretation rules  
- Fire: live it—justice, mercy, repentance, worship, and resilient obedience
