# Cross-Link Types
Status: CANONICAL
Version: v2026-01-26

## Allowed edge types (use exactly these)
- **echoes** — repeating motif/theme without direct fulfillment claim
- **fulfills** — explicit fulfillment pattern (prophecy/pattern → fulfillment)
- **contrasts** — deliberate inversion or opposing pattern
- **extends** — builds a theme into a larger framework
- **anchors** — establishes baseline definition for later links
- **clarifies** — resolves ambiguity by linking to a clearer passage/section
- **governs** — policy/guardrails that constrain interpretation or action

## Edge minimum fields
- type
- from_node
- to_node
- justification (1–3 sentences)
- tags (3–10 controlled terms)
