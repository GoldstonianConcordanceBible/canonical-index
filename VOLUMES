# VIII-01 — MIRROR
**Theme:** Truth-telling before God (AI as flashlight, not judge)

## Purpose Thesis
Expose self-deception and motive drift so discernment stays anchored in repentance, humility, and obedience.

## Key tests
- Does this output increase humility or pride?
- Does it move me toward obedience or endless analysis?
- Did I ask AI to *seek truth* or *win*?

## Practices
- Confession inventory (private, honest, non-performative)
- Bias audit (what answer did I want?)
- Fruit check (peace, clarity, patience, courage)

## Outputs
- One-page “Truth Snapshot”
- One-page “Next Obedience Step”
- Receipts: what sources influenced the conclusion
