# Series VIII Overview — Augmented Discernment

## Purpose Thesis
To form readers who can use AI powerfully **without surrendering spiritual authority**—keeping Scripture, prayer, counsel, repentance, and obedience primary.

## Placement + Canon Notes
- **Primary authority:** Scripture (as received in your canon framework).
- **Secondary tools:** commentaries, history, language tools, AI, and “agents.”
- **Rule:** secondary tools can *clarify*, but cannot *command*.
